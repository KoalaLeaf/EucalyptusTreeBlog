### Why the hell is the point of this site

Honestly dawg I got no clue. 

I dont have any major plans for this site. Its mainly just going to be an outlet for me to share and talk about things I'm interested in. 

I also am using it as an opportunity practice web development as I only have a little experience with HMTL/CSS. However I can add shit like this:

What other website has such waky and zany images as this! None! Beacause its never been done before (dont check please)


## How its made

(Man I love that show.)

This site is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses Github pages to publish the site. I had a little trouble getting it up and running at firt but I eventually got it working. I am by no stretch of the word *knowledgable* about the features Hugo offers, but I intend to keep doing research and improve it little by little. 

So if you see any artifacts or funky formatting...mind your business: ![alt text](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fg5w6tivd4e051.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Db5a4cf8580b2581378f3e97e02ca5aa2f8e092e1&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=6366d16774a7a8af79cfebd3c082b2b4f5fe92c43d1d8b096d8051472d019206&ipo=images)
