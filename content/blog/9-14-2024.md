# What is going on in the Spotify HQ?

It stands to reason that Spotify board of directors must have all collectively broken out a circus with how much bafoonery has occured as a result of their 'directing'. 

I had recently had the displeasure of trying to get an access token to their API. I spent multiple hours trying the stupid fucking curl command over and over again with a base64 encodeder on my other monitor. After my 9th attempt I was running low on my will to live. So I decided to just copy embeded links and you can see that result [here](/music).

Ah! I know what youre gonna say, *yes* its 100% a skill issue because Im a moron who wont read the docs. You would be right; **BUT** you see, this is just fuel to the metaphorical fire that is my hatred for this platform. So much hatred in fact, that I'm going to write a entire essay about it! ![alt text](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/096/564/2f7.jpg)






## You know what really grinds my gears?

Greed.

And oh *BOY* let me tell you that Spotify has no shortage of it. They are one of the worst offenders when it comes to actually *paying* the artists that keep their platform alive. In fact, they only pay $0.004 USD per stream!

A very generous, **.004** american smackaroos. Meaning in order to make 1 dollar, you need more than 200 streams. 

Heres what you're thinking: "Well running a company costs money, a-a-a-and, thats all they can afford to pay! wah wah...". 

To counter, I would say, fucking **Napster** pays more than Spotify does, at $0.019 per stream (Oh yea, they have a streaming service. Look it up). Still insultingly low, however over 4 times more than the *small* and *struggling* poor little company that is Spotify:

>Total Revenue was up 20% Y/Y to â‚¬3.8 billion. - [*Spotify Reports Second Quarter 2024 Earnings*](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-07-23/spotify-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings/) 

The money is there, its just not going to the artists. Its going *directly* into the pockets of the execs. To be more precise, it put [$345 million](https://musictech.com/news/industry/daniel-ek-made-more-money-spotify-in-2024-than-any-artist/), directly into, the CEO, Daniel Ek's pockets. Putting that number into perspective, an artist would have to have 86.25 BILLION streams on Spotify to make that much from the platform. The most popular artist on Spotify in 2023 being Taylor swift, but she only managed to reach 26.1 billion. She would have roughly made 104.4 million from Spotify (which is still insane btw), aha but 'ol Danny boy here he still gets to make **triple** what she does. Why you ask?

There always seems to be a point in a company's history where their priority shifts from, offering customers the best possible experience, to offering customers the experience that is most *profitable* for them. Whenever a company knowingly degrades the experience of their service for the sake of increasing profit margins, it shows the stark reality that they dont give a singular *fuck* about their customers. 


# CarThing-gate

At the intersection of bad business decision and borderline exit scam you have the Spotify car thing. In the beginning when it was first launched, most people were under the impression that the car thing could be used to bring wireless connectivity to older cars that didnt have it. If it would've been able to connect to your cars radio and play songs wirelessly from the device itself, that would make be a legitatemly usefull product however, we now all know the truth of what the device is *actually capable of*. 

It seems that from the beginning Spotfiy was being *intentioanlly* vague when annoucing it, neglecting to mention to consumers that the car thing was essenitiall just a glorified music *controller*. Meaning you still needed a wireless capable device and a way of connecting said device to your car stereo. At release, this $100 device was only  capable of selecting and changing the music that was playing from another device. The same thing could be accomplished with a smartphone and a car mount. 

The actuall hardware of the device is nothing to write home about. A small touch screen, a couple programmable shortcut buttons and a big ass rotary dial on the front. It could also be controlled via voice commands by saying "Hey Spotify" in the nerdiest voice possible.  ![alt text](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WJK8QK5NcmbQpHvF3iLmvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/09f66b90-9c16-11eb-8bfd-ac16faa96e5e)

If this were the end of the story, we could say the only thing Spotify is guilty of, is misleading marketing. But as you probably can tell at this point its not, because earlier this year, Spotify announced that they would be 'Discontinueing' the car thing on December 9th of this year. 

Oh what so they stop pushing updates to it, or no longer sell it or something? NOPE. They are completely bricking the devices via a firmware update and it will become [unusuable](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/). "Thats right valued customers! Remember that $50-100 device you purchased from us, well we've decided you no longer get to use it ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—". 

That is such a ridiculous slap in the face to customers who trusted you enough to support your attempt at diversifying. 

And Spotify's reasoning for this decision? Well, I'll let you read it for yourself.
>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users. - [Spotify Article](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/)


Basically, because it wasnt as profitable as they would've hoped.
