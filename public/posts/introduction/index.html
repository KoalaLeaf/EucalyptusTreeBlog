Honestly dawg I got no clue.
I dont have any major plans for this site. Its mainly just going to be an outlet for me to share and talk about things I&rsquo;m interested in.
I also am using it as an opportunity practice web development as I only have a little experience with HMTL/CSS. However I can add shit like this:">
