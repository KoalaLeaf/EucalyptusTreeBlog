It stands to reason that Spotify board of directors must have all collectively broken out a circus with how much bafoonery has occured as a result of their &lsquo;directing&rsquo;.
I had recently had the displeasure of trying to get an access token to their API. I spent multiple hours trying the stupid fucking curl command over and over again with a base64 encodeder on my other monitor. After my 9th attempt I was running low on my will to live.

<p>It stands to reason that Spotify board of directors must have all collectively broken out a circus with how much bafoonery has occured as a result of their &lsquo;directing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I had recently had the displeasure of trying to get an access token to their API. I spent multiple hours trying the stupid fucking curl command over and over again with a base64 encodeder on my other monitor. After my 9th attempt I was running low on my will to live. So I decided to just copy embeded links and you can see that result <a href="/music">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ah! I know what youre gonna say, <em>yes</em> its 100% a skill issue because Im a moron who wont read the docs. You would be right; <strong>BUT</strong> you see, this is just fuel to the metaphorical fire that is my hatred for this platform. So much hatred in fact, that I&rsquo;m going to write a entire essay about it! <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/096/564/2f7.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
<h2 id="you-know-what-really-grinds-my-gears">You know what really grinds my gears?</h2>
<p>Greed.</p>
<p>And oh <em>BOY</em> let me tell you that Spotify has no shortage of it. They are one of the worst offenders when it comes to actually <em>paying</em> the artists that keep their platform alive. In fact, they only pay $0.004 USD per stream!</p>
<p>A very generous, <strong>.004</strong> american smackaroos. Meaning in order to make 1 dollar, you meed more than 300 streams.</p>
<p>Heres what you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;Well running a company costs money, a-a-a-and, thats all they can afford to pay! wah wah&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To counter, I would say, fucking <strong>Napster</strong> pays more than Spotify does, at $0.019 per stream (Oh yea, they have a streaming service. Look it up). Still insultingly low, however over 4 times more than the <em>small</em> and <em>struggling</em> poor little company that is Spotify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total Revenue was up 20% Y/Y to €3.8 billion. - <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-07-23/spotify-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings/"><em>Spotify Reports Second Quarter 2024 Earnings</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The money is there, its just not going to the artists. Its going <em>directly</em> into the pockets of the execs. To be more precise, it put <a href="https://musictech.com/news/industry/daniel-ek-made-more-money-spotify-in-2024-than-any-artist/">$345 million</a>, directly into, the CEO, Daniel Ek&rsquo;s pockets. Putting that number into perspective, an artist would have to have 86.25 BILLION streams on Spotify to make that much from the platform. The most popular artist on Spotify in 2023 being Taylor swift, but she only managed to reach 26.1 billion. She would have roughly made 104.4 million from Spotify (which is insane btw), aha but &lsquo;ol Danny boy here he still gets to make <strong>triple</strong> what she does. Why?</p>
